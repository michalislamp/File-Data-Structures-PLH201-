At a few minutes past ten oclock of the morning of November 11 1918 the Secretary of War in Washington received from General Pershing a communication informing the Government that eleven oclock am that day French time an armistice with Germany had gone into effect No message more momentous had ever come to the American War Department The World War was at an end It was peace It was victory  Over there on that American front which had penetrated the supposedly impregnable Argonne and now commanded the enemys main line of communications at Sedan boys in our own khaki wriggled charged fought plunged ahead all the morning like the players of some mighty football team gaining every inch of advance possible before an intermission and finally as the whistles shrilled and the great silence fell at last upon a theatre that had shaken and roared with the thunder of war for more than four years they set their heels into the turf of a line that was to be held as a startingoff place if the armistice too should prove to be only an intermission and a period of recuperation  Behind these outpost men were the American Expeditionary Forces two million strong Behind the A E F in America was a training and maintenance army nearly as numerous  Behind the uniformed and organized Army as it existed on the eleventh day of November was another force of a quarter of a million men technically under arms These were Selective Service men drafted men entraining that day and adding themselves to the human flood sweeping on toward Germany In number this force alone was larger than any2 ever previously enrolled at one time in the American military service except the forces called to the colors during the Civil War yet so expanded had become our values that they attracted only passing attention in the midst of larger war activities These inductives were one more incrementthat was all  And behind the Army itself were twentyfive million American men between the ages of eighteen and fortyfive registered classified and numbered in the order in which they too in turn should join the current that led if necessary to the supreme sacrifice  The foundation on which rested this human edifice was industrial Nothing less than the whole of Americas material resources had been pledged to the end of victory The whole of Americas resources How inadequately could pigmy man realize their might before he took them all and formed and molded them into one singlepurpose machine That machine was born in travail that broke mens bodies and reputations that threw down the mighty from their seats and exalted those of low degree that moved inexorably but surely And when the machine was built it released forces terrifying even to men accustomed to administering the greatest of human activities forces wellnigh ungovernable  It took seven million workers men and women to operate the war industrial machineseven million Americans delving in the earth for ores chemicals and fuels felling the forests quarrying the rocks carrying the raw materials to the mills tending the fires and the furnaces operating the cranes guiding the finishing machinery with a precision never before demanded slaughtering the beeves curing the meat packing the vegetables weaving the fabrics fashioning the garments transporting all and accomplishing the million separate tasks necessary to the munitioning of the Army  And as a background to all this behind both the military and the industrial armies was another force perhaps the greatest force of allthe will of the people themselves of one hundred million Americans who without the coercion and3 duress of law and as a purely voluntary act denied their appetites their pleasures and their vanities contributed their utmost to the war finances made war gardens to add to the food supply produced millions of articles for the comfort of the soldiers both well and wounded and in one way or another put forth effort that did not flag until victory came  Such was America in a war that truly threatened her existenceAmerica invincible  The armistice put an end to all this enterprise and effort It did morethe armistice was a command to the Government to scrap the war machine and restore its parts to the peaceful order in which they had been found In military law an armistice denotes the temporary cessation of hostilities but the armistice of 1918 was a finality Its terms destroyed the German military power Those in authority aware that the armistice was to be no period of waiting with collected forces for the outcome of negotiations did not pause even to survey the magnitude of the thing they had built they turned immediately to the task of dismantling it Some of the processes of demobilization began before the guns ceased to fire Five days before the armistice the A E F canceled many of the foreign orders for important supplies On November 1 we stopped sending combatant troops to France In late October the Ordnance Department created an organization for demobilizing war industry  However before the machine could be knocked down and its parts distributed it had to be stopped There are two ways of stopping the limited express One is to throw a switch ahead of iteffective but disastrous to the train The other way is to put on the brakes  The warindustry machine had attained a momentum almost beyond mundane comparisons Slow in gaining headway like any other great mass as thousands added their brains and their muscles to its progress it gathered speed until at the first day of the armistice it was nearing the point at which it could consume the material resources and turn them out as finished war products up to the capacity of American mechanical skill4 and machinery to handle them It had not quite reached that point Many of the vital but easily manufactured supplies had long since reached the pinnacles of their production curves but some of the more difficult ones were not yet in full manufacture On Armistice Day however the industry was not more than six months away from the planned limit of its fecundity  For the administration of the industrial enterprise the task ahead was first to bring that momentum to a halt and then to break up the machine The easiest way was to throw a switch ahead of itin other words to issue a blanket stoporder on all military manufacturing projects But to have done that would have been to court consequences as disastrous as those of war itself Business and industry would have fallen into chaos and the country would have been filled with jobless men The other way the way chosen was to apply the brakes to the thousands of wheels  The magnitude of the task ahead was appalling The liquidation of the war industry was seen to be a matter as complex as intricate as full of the possibilities of error and failure as the mobilization itself In only one respect did demobilization begin with an advantage there was at hand an organization the organization which had administered the creation of the Army and the manufacture of its supplies ready to be turned into a wrecking crew  It was necessary for the organization not only to remain intact but to speed the activities of demobilization as it had sped those of mobilization The prearmistice spirit had in some way to be maintained On November 11 the war was costing the United States about 50000000 a day Every day of indecision in adopting the plan of demobilization and every days delay in carrying out the plan added tremendously to the burden of taxation that would rest upon the nation for generations to come  Demobilization meant first of all the disbanding of the American Army Whatever economic considerations might graduate the termination of war industry no such considerations were to be permitted to retard the homeward progress of the troops Four million American homes demanded their men at once and whether the immediate return of the troops meant unemployment and distress or not the Government was determined to comply with the demand  The creation of the Army and its movement toward France had involved the rail transportation of about 8000000 soldiers in special cars and trains The home movement would require an operation almost as great Of the 2000000 men of the American Expeditionary Forces more than half had crossed the ocean in foreign ships all of which of course were withdrawn from our service immediately after the armistice The unbroken eastward transatlantic procession of troopships had continued for about fourteen months On the first day of the armistice the transatlantic ferrying capacity of the Americanflag troopships was not much in excess of 100000 men a month Moreover practically all our troop transports had reached the point of having to be laid up for reconditioning Assuming however that they could be kept in continuous operation they could not bring back to America more than twothirds of the troops in the time it had taken the whole6 A E F to cross to France Yet the problem of demobilization was to repatriate the A E F in that time at most  Demobilization involved a final cash settlement with everyone of the four million men under arms computations of back pay complicated as they were with allotments and payments for government war bonds and the war risk insurance and finally the payment to each soldier of the sixtydollar bonus voted by the Congress Demobilization also included the care of the wounded for many months after the fighting ceased their physical and mental reconstruction and their reducation to enable them to take useful places in the world  On the industrial side demobilization was the liquidation of a business whose commitments had reached the staggering total of 35000000000 Demobilization meant taking practically the entire industrial structure of the United States which had become one vast munitions plant and converting it again into an instrumentality for producing the commodities of peaceful commerce This without stopping an essential wheel and also in the briefest possible time for the world was in sore need of these products Efficient demobilization it follows would permit the 7000000 industrial war workers to turn without a break in employment from the production of war supplies to that of peace supplies  At the base of modern business stability lies the inviolability of contracts He who breaches a contract must expect to pay indemnity and the Government cannot except itself from this rule Demobilization meant the suspension and termination of war contracts running into billions in value many of them without a scrap of paper to show as a written instrument it meant termination without laying the Government open to the payment of damages and therefore it implied the honorable adjustment of the claims of the contractors  One of the conditions on which complete demobilization depended was the adoption of a future military policy for the United States But this was in the hands not of the military organization but of Congress The whole program therefore could not be put through until Congress had acted After the7 policy was defined then it became the duty of the demobilization forces to choose and store safely the reserve equipment for the permanent establishment and for the field use of a possible future combatant force until another war industry could be brought into existence  When that had been done there would remain a surplus of military property It thereupon became the function of demobilization to dispose of this property through a sales organization that would have in its stocks goods of a greater variety and value than those at the disposal of any private sales agency in the United States This branch of the work also included the sale of great quantities of A E F supplies in Europe which was already glutted with the surpluses of its own armies The sales at home must include the sale of hundreds of buildings put up for the war establishment  Paradoxically demobilization included the acquirement of large quantities of real estatefor the storage of reserve supplies and the creation of a physical plant for the permanent military establishment  Finally demobilization meant the delicate business of striking a cash balance that would terminate our relations with the Allies meeting their claims against us for the supply of materials and for the use and destruction of private property abroad and pressing our own claims against them for materials sold to them  The astonishing thing was the swiftness with which this great program was carried through Within a year after the last gun was fired America had returned to the normal The whole A E F had been brought back in American vessels in ten months In that time practically the entire Army had been paid off disbanded and transported to its homes War businesses were braked to a standstill in an average time of three months without a single industrial disturbance of any consequence At the end of the year the greater part of the manufacturers claims had been satisfied with compromises fair both to the contractors and to the Government The savings in contract terminations and adjustments had run into billions of8 dollars A blanket settlement had been made with the Allies thus virtually closing up our business in Europe A permanent military policy had been written into law The storage buildings and spaces were filled with reserve materials inventoried catalogued and protected against deterioration Packed away compactly were the tools and machinery of an embryonic war industry ready to be expanded at will in the event of another war Materials largely of special war value and therefore normally to be regarded as scrap and junk had been sold to the tune of billions the exercise of ingenuity in the sales department producing a recovery that was remarkably large averaging 64 per cent of the war cost  Such was our war demobilization No other single business enterprise in all human history compared with it in magnitude yet in the midst of the peace negotiations and amid the economic crises fretting the earth it attracted scant notice Today only the continuing sale of surplus war materials and the adjudication of the last and most difficult of the industrial claims give evidence of the enterprise which engaged the efforts of the whole nation so short a time ago  The American Expeditionary Forces on November 11 1918 were ill prepared to conduct the manifold activities leading to their demobilization Up to that day the expedition had been too busy going ahead to think much about how it was to get home But now had come the armistice the end The great adventure was over The guerre was fini  At once a great wave of homesickness spread over the A E F That song of careless valor Where do we go from here to the swinging beat of which a million men had marched forward over the French roads became a querulous When do we go home When indeed It had taken nearly a year and a half to transport the A E F to France Disregarding the fact that the Army overseas had at its disposal less than half as many troopships as had supported it up to November 11 before the men could start home in great numbers there had first to be created in France an embarkation system with a capacious equipment of camps and port buildings if the expedition were to return in good order and not as a disorganized mob  Never was a daily journal scanned with such emotion as was the Stars and Stripes by its readers during this period of waiting The Stars and Stripes was the official newspaper of the enlisted men of the A E F After the armistice anything pertaining to the return of the troops to America was the most important news which the publication could possibly print The Stars and Stripes published the monthly schedules of transport sailings told of the extraordinary expansion of the10 Yankee transport fleet noted the continual improvement in the shipping efficiency of that fleet rejoiced in blackface type when some ocean flyer broke the record for the turnaround as the round trip to America and back was called and in general kept the personnel of the expedition informed of the movement homeward But although the return of the A E F was a transportation feat actually more astonishing than that which had placed the forces in Europe yet to the hundreds of thousands of homesick boys who watched the brown fields of France turn green in the spring of 1919 the pace of the snail and the turtle seemed speed itself in comparison to the progress made by the demobilization machine  The A E F in November 1918 possessed no port equipment capable of quick conversion into a plant for embarking the expedition There had been no need of large port installations in France for the use of debarking troops The A E F had crossed to France under a scheme of identification that was a marvel of system and organization Once the system was perfected every military unit bore as part of its name a socalled item number that told the debarkation officers by reference to the shipping schedules exactly where each unit should go upon arrival So it was with individuals and small detachments traveling as casuals Their item numbers placed them instantly in the great structure of the A E F No need for vast port rest camps in which thousands must wait until G H Q disposed of them They were placed before they sailed from America Expense and confusion saved by the art of management  The armistice changed all about Our military ports in France had to become ports for the embarkation of troops with an equipment vastly expanded America had sent to France an Army perfectly clothed and accoutered For the sake of uniformity the home ports of embarkation had prepared the 2000000 troops for the voyage and this meant issuing smaller or larger quantities of clothing and other personal articles to practically every man who sailed The A E F proposed to return its men to their homes well dressed clean11 and selfrespecting and it was logical too to accomplish this purpose in France in the process of embarking the troops To carry out the plan however required an extensive plant something not to be materialized by a wave of the hand France after the armistice was to witness an extensive military construction carried on by the Americans at their ports  Brest Bordeaux and St Nazaire had been the three principal landing places for our troops sent to France directly from the United States Brest near the northeasternmost extremity of France possessed a harbor with water that could accommodate the largest ships afloat but the water near shore was too shallow for docks at which large ships could berth Consequently the troops rode in lighters between ships and shore This was Brests chief disadvantage as a military port but it was not a serious disadvantage  Next southward came St Nazaire on the Loire River a few miles inland The first of the expeditionary troops landed at St Nazaire in July 1917 The port boasted of docks with berths for troopships but the waters of the river were too shallow for the largest transports  Still farther south was Bordeaux fiftytwo miles from the ocean on the Gironde River What few troops landed at Bordeaux were incidental for the port construction at Bordeaux and other great developments at Bassens and Pauillac nearer the mouth of the river were conducted by the A E F with the view of making the Gironde the chief ocean terminal for the reception of army supplies shipped from the United States Troopships could tie up to the docks at Bordeaux but the Gironde was so narrow and its tidal currents were so swift that the military administration of the port had to manage the stream on a schedule as it might operate a singletrack railroad There were several places in the river where vessels could not pass each other  After November 11 followed a few days of indecision and bewilderment in the A E F No one in Europe knew precisely what the armistice meant or what the victorious armies could expect Quickly however it transpired that the armistice was12 permanent it was peace itself for all practical purposes and the only forces we should need to maintain in France would be those chosen to conduct the measured advance into Germany and to garrison the occupied territory Within a week General Pershing designated the troops for the Army of Occupation and released the rest of the American Expeditionary Forces more than half its total numerical strength for return to the United States as soon as transportation facilities were available He charged the Chief Quartermaster of the expedition with the duty of embarking the returning forces1  The Chief Quartermaster of the A E F at once designated Brest St Nazaire and Bordeaux as the ports of embarkation The early plan was to send 20 per cent of the expedition home via Bordeaux and the rest in equal numbers through St Nazaire and Brest As it worked out practically all the overseas soldiers returned through these three ports although a few sailed from Marseilles Le Havre and La Pallice The division of work however did not materialize as planned Bordeaux handled less than its fifth of the forces and the embarkations at St Nazaire were not much larger than those at Bordeaux The great mass of the A E F came back via Brest and at Brest was set up the largest installation for the embarkation of passengers the world had ever seen  With the combat troops mass travel could be conducted at its greatest efficiency The divisional troops were homogeneous their transportation needs were essentially alike and a single order could control the movements of tens of thousands of them at once The supply troops on the other hand were heterogeneous They were organized in thousands of units of varying sizes and kinds Many of them particularly officers were serving in the organization as individuals attached to no particular units The travel problems of these various elements differed widely Therefore it was decided to handle the embarkation of divisional troops and supply troops separately The general demobilization plan adopted about the middle of December 1918 provided for the establishment of a great embarkation center for the divisional troopsan area which should be convenient to all three ports of embarkation in which area the combat troops in their large units could be prepared for the overseas voyage and from which they could go directly to the ships without pausing in the embarkation cities The installations at the ports themselves were to be used especially in the embarkation of supply troops  At Le Mans a spot about midway between Paris and the Biscay coast the A E F possessed a plant that might be expanded quickly to serve as the divisional embarkation center When the great flood of American troops began debouching upon French soil in the early summer of 1918 it became evident to the command of the expedition that it needed an area in which the incoming divisions might assemble as their units debarked from the transports and where they might rest while their ranks were being built up to prescribed strength by the addition of replacements By this time too the system of supplying replacement troops to the A E F had become automatic The replacements were the only American soldiers who crossed to France without definite objective They were to be used in France as the A E F needed them to fill up its divisional ranks It was necessary therefore to provide14 a reservoir upon which the depleted combat divisions could draw for replacements Le Mans was selected as the site of this reservoir and also as the assembling point for the debarking organized divisions The Le Mans area before the armistice was known as the A E Fs classification and replacement camp  The reasons which brought about the selection of Le Mans as the site for the replacement and divisional depot served also to make the place the ideal location for the expeditions embarkation center Le Mans was at the junction of trunkline railroads leading to Brest St Nazaire and Bordeaux It also possessed good railroad connections with Paris and with the front which in the summer of 1918 had been advanced by the Germans until it was close to the metropolitan limits of Paris and was therefore not far from Le Mans The depot was established in July 1918 when the Eightythird Division occupied the area as its depot division At that time the depot as projected contemplated the construction of eight divisional camps each to accommodate 26000 men and two forwarding camps one with accommodations for 25000 men and the other for 15000 In other words the camp eventually was to accommodate a quarter of a million troops No military center in the United States compared in size with this project  At the time of the armistice the development of Le Mans had made good progress It could then maintain about 120000 troops On December 14 when Le Mans was officially designated as the embarkation center its capacity had been increased to 200000 Shortly after the armistice began its transient population jumped to 100000 and it never fell below this mark until the late spring of 1919 when the greater part of the combat divisions of the A E F had embarked for the United States  The Le Mans center had the duty of completely preparing for embarkation all troops received in the area Theoretically every man who passed through Le Mans was prepared to go directly to a transport This meant bathing and delousing for every man who came to the camp inspecting his equipment15 and supplying new clothing and other personal articles if he needed them and perfecting his service records so that he might encounter no difficulty in securing his final pay and discharge in the United States To do this important work quickly and well it was necessary to operate an institution of impressive size  The dimensions of the whole camp were tremendous There was nothing like it in the United States A man could walk briskly for an hour in a single direction at Le Mans and see nothing but tents barracks drill fields and troops lined up for preliminary or final inspections The task of feeding this city full of guests was so great that the camp administration found it economical to build a narrowgauge railroad system connecting the kitchens with the warehouses Food moved up to the camp cookstoves by the trainload and the same locomotives that brought the supplies hauled away the refuse A whole adjacent forest was cut down to supply firewood When the Americans occupied the section there were no adequate switching facilities nor were there storage accommodations The Quartermaster Corps which operated the storage project cleared a field in the midst of a wood and used the clearing for an open storage space the surrounding trees giving a degree of shelter connecting the place with the railroad by constructing a spur track Thereafter even after great warehouses had been built in the clearing and it had become the supply depot for the entire camp requiring the services of 6000 troops in its operation the place was known to the camp as The Spur As an addition to this storage smaller covered warehouses were provided at all the divisional subdepots At one time the corrals of the camp contained 10000 horses and mules In one week in February 1919 nearly 32000 troops arrived in camp a fact indicating the rate at which troops passed through to embarkation The Quartermaster Corps opened two great central commissaries that were in effect department stores The camp operated a large laundry a shoe repair shop a clothing repair shop and numerous other industrial plants  16  The equipment installed at Le Mans was duplicated in smaller scale at the three embarkation ports Yet even these port installations could not be called small Camp Pontanezen at Brest could give accommodations to 80000 men at once The largest embarkation camps in the United States were smaller than this There were thirteen smaller camps and military posts at Brest The two embarkation camps at Bordeaux could house 22000 men but there were billeting accommodations in the district for thousands of others The construction at St Nazaire was considerably larger than that at Bordeaux but not so extensive as that at Brest  Most of these camps were built after the armistice and the engineer constructors and the embarking troops elbowed each other as embarkation and construction proceeded simultaneously Some of the camps had served as rest camps prior to the armistice but these had to be greatly enlarged and improved in equipment before they could give adequate service as embarkation camps The weather along the northwestern coast of France is intensely uncomfortable and disagreeable to Americans In the winter and spring especially the rains and mists are almost incessant It was not always possible to choose ideal sites for the embarkation camps in France The sites had to be near the ports and in the thickly inhabited countryside the American authorities were forced to accept whatsoever areas they could get without being too insistent upon such fine points as natural drainage and pleasant surroundings  This statement is particularly applicable to Pontanezen which was pitched on high but poorly drained ground Ordinarily the Army would not have occupied such a location without first making permanent improvements The continual rains the lack of strong drainage and the heavy traffic of men animals and trucks combined to make the Pontanezen site in 1919 a morass of quaking mud Only the strongest of emergencies justified its use Because of the daily cost of maintaining the A E F and because the expeditionary soldiers themselves wished to return home as soon as possible regardless of the conditions of their travel it was decided to make use of17 these port camps even while they were being constructed instead of holding up the whole movement until the camp arrangements could be made perfect  Tales of suffering among our soldiers at Pontanezen came to the United States and were even aired on the floors of Congress but the suffering alleged was more apparent than real Those who went through the experience of residence in Pontanezen even at its worst were not injured in health Despite appearances the camps sanitary arrangements were of high merit The medical records of Camp Pontanezen show that its sickness and death rates leaving the domestic epidemic of influenza altogether out of the comparison were as low as those of the best camps in the United States  In the spring of 1919 most of the construction work at the embarkation camps was complete and they became more comfortable The camps consisted of miles of onestory tarpapered roughboard buildings connected with wooden sidewalks of duckboards Pontanezen was a complete American city set down amid the quaint roads of old Brittany It had newspapers banks theatres stores public libraries restaurants hospitals churches telephones and electric lights and even a narrowgauge railway for freighting about its supplies The entire American military population in the camps at Brest quite outnumbered the French inhabitants of the region The water system installed by the Engineers to serve all the American establishments at the port was sufficient for the city of 150000 people There was a special camp for casual officers A section of this camp was set aside for the French English Belgian and Italian wives that American soldiers had married abroad There was a hospital camp a camp for the white troops on permanent duty at the port and another for colored troops so assigned There were numerous small camps for labor battalions and a special camp for engineer and motor transport organizations Not far away was a large German prison camp  In one important respect embarkation in France differed from what it had been in the United States It was extremely18 necessary to rid the homecoming troops of body vermin before placing them on the ships The delousing process at our French ports of embarkation was the most thorough experienced by the doughboy during his foreign service and this process chiefly distinguished embarkation abroad from that which the soldier had known at Hoboken and Newport News  Our forebears shared none of the modern aversion to discussion of the louse One of the great monarchs of France set the stamp of his royal approval upon scratching publicly when one itched and Robert Burns once addressed a poem to a louse The louse however cannot survive American habits of personal cleanliness and justly enough the insect has become associated with filth and has dropped out of polite conversation The war revived the fame of this parasite An inspection at one time revealed the fact that 90 per cent of the American troops at the front were infested These men naturally wrote home about it and then the louse euphemized as cootie became a national figure  There was a serious aspect to the situation however that the military authorities could not overlook Besides being a source of discomfort the louse is the sole carrier of one of the most dread diseases that afflict mankindtyphus fever In bygone times typhus was known variously as army fever camp fever or jail fever It was particularly prevalent in this country at the time of the Revolution and it existed to some extent here during the Civil Waran indication of what must have been the condition of individual American soldiers in those days Typhus exists today practically as an endemic on the central plateau of Mexico the range of the disease touching the border of the United States The disease cannot invade this country however because of the lack of carriers But if the A E F had returned to the United States with its 2000000 men liceinfested the demobilized soldiers might have distributed typhus carriers from one end of the country to the other and exposed the nation to a terrible menace  The sanitary regulations of the A E F kept typhus away from the troops by controlling the lice The Quartermaster19 Corps operated a number of mobile delousing plants just behind the front lines and in the billeting areas to the rear It is interesting to note that these plants had to be camouflaged because the airmen of the enemy sometimes mistook them for batteries of artillery and directed gunfire upon them As these plants increased in number and efficiency they reduced the lousiness of the combat troops to a scant 3 per cent  As long as our troops remained in France largely billeted on the French population it was unlikely that the field sanitary measures could extinguish the louse altogether but the command of the expedition determined that at the ports of embarkation the American doughboy should bid goodbye to P vestimenti forever The importance of completely delousing the troops was emphasized in the same G H Q memorandum that had set up the embarkation system  In pursuance of this policy every embarkation camp in France was established in two isolated sections One section was known as the dirty camp and the other as the clean camp Upon arrival from the front the troops first took quarters in the dirty camp Between the two sections lay the buildings in which the camp administration conducted all the various processes of preparing soldiers for embarkation for the United States One of the most important of these activities was bathing and delousing the troops As far as scientific measures could prevent it not a louse was permitted to cross from the dirty camp to the clean camp The measures were highly effective Only a few men were found to be infested upon arrival in America For these there were final delousing facilities at all our debarkation camps When the overseas veterans took trains for home at the Atlantic ports they were completely verminless The medical officers at the demobilization centers in this country failed to discover a single exception  The embarkation plant at Bordeaux was known to returning soldiers as The Mill Its processes were typical of those at all the embarkation camps in France The Bordeaux mill ground swiftly yet ground exceeding fine To it came the20 raw materialdirty ragged weary humanity It reached out for this material whirled it into its machinery and a little while later delivered from the other end its finished productclean wellclothed deloused and comfortable American soldiers their service records compiled up to the minute American money in their pockets and a mighty selfrespect swelling their chests  To France America sent the best clothed and best equipped army that had ever stepped on European soil The two million men arrived in France outfitted almost completely in new clothing and equipment which they had received in the American embarkation camps just before they boarded the transports In 1919 we brought home the first American army that had ever fought in a great war and returned in anything but rags By special act Congress gave permission to each discharged soldier to keep his uniform and certain other equipment when he returned to civilian life Even though for most of the men coming up into the embarkation ports in France their final discharge was only a few weeks away nevertheless the military organization there saw to it that every man was decently clad before he began the return voyage and this often meant the issue of entirely new articles The Quartermaster Corps abroad wanted to win from the folks at home the verdict when they had looked over their restored boysGuess they took pretty good care of you over there after all  The mill at Bordeaux was housed in a long low hut with separate departments for the chief operations necessary to the preparation of troops for embarkation the steps being arranged progressively At the entrance end were the executive offices Here the soldier as he passed through received his service records withdrawn from his companys files and also a Red Cross bag in which to carry his personal trinkets and his record cards and papers on the journey through the mill Next he came to the records inspection section where officers perfected the entries in his record Here he also received a copy of the orders under which his unit was traveling his pay card and a card known as the individual equipment record On21 the equipment card appeared the printed names of all articles which a completely outfitted American soldier should wear or carry wherever he went Next the soldier stood before an inspector who examined the worn equipment noted wherein it was incomplete labeled any damaged or wornout articles for discard and salvage and checked on the equipment card such new articles as should be issued to the soldier later on The standard equipment of each returning soldier was as follows  The soldier next went to the disrobing room where he divested himself of all clothing except his shoes which he was to carry through with him The cootie would not cling to leather Then he passed on to a medical examination for infectious disease If he passed this safely he proceeded to the bathing department where under the watchful eyes of a sergeant22 he soaped and scrubbed himself thoroughly first in a hot shower bath and then in a cold one Experience had taught that the greatest enemy of the louse was plain soap and water and plenty of it Meanwhile certain of his discarded garments if they were in good condition or if they could be repaired for future wear had been sent from the disrobing room to the steam sterilizer in another part of the building The sterilization process took thirty minutes which was just about the time it took the soldier to go through the mill  Scrubbed and clean the soldier went from the bath into another room where doctors examined him for diseases of the throat lungs and skin After that the barber shop and a hair cut The barber shop at the mill was equipped with fifty chairs  At last the object of these official attentions reached his goal the equipment room What he had feared in the process were the two medical inspections either of which might stop his progress instanter and send him scurrying to a camp hospital for observation or treatment In either circumstance his embarkation would be deferred indefinitely But if he were allowed to reach the equipment room he knew he was safe Here he found great bins containing large quantities of the articles named on the equipment card As he passed the bins every soldier received clean socks and underclothing new tape for his identification tags and a clean shelter half in which to carry his equipment He also received such new articles as were checked on his equipment card  The processes at the other embarkation camps were essentially the same In each of the Le Mans divisional camps was installed a bathing and delousing plant with a capacity of 1200 men an hour For the sterilization of clothing in the area there were three large central disinfesting plants five smaller stationary steam sterilizers and more than a dozen mobile sterilizers  The two port camps at Bordeaux were known as Camp Neuve and Camp Genicart After the armistice these two camps were reorganized and enlarged Camp Neuve became the dirty or entrance camp It accommodated 5400 men Camp Genicart was designated as the clean or evacuation camp and its barracks could house nearly 17000 men The24 busiest day for Bordeaux was Sunday May 11 1919 when 6399 men passed through the mill and made ready to embark St Nazaire handled 15306 embarkations on June 17 1919 its record day  Salvage was an important operation at all the embarkation points in France Thousands of articles of apparel discarded by the returning troops were not so worn but that they could be made serviceable again The salvage plant at Le Mans could repair 1700 pairs of shoes dryclean sterilize and repair 4000 pieces of clothing wash 10000 garments in the laundry and disinfect 10000 blankets every day The plant occupied eight buildings and the average value of clothing repaired monthly was over 150000 There were salvage plants also at Brest St Nazaire and Bordeaux the one at Brest being of great size  The task of feeding men at the embarkation camps gave the Quartermaster Corps one of its chief problems Each divisional subdepot at Le Mans carried at all times sufficient food to supply the appetites of 25000 men for fifteen days and in addition the central warehouses contained 500000 emergency rations to substitute for the garrison rations if anything went wrong with the food supply In December 1918 the subsistence services in the area had been built up to the capacity of 500000 rations cooked and served each day  At Brest also the feeding arrangements were laid out on an immense scale The men ate food prepared in standard kitchens each capable of providing subsistence for thousands The coldstorage and other storage spaces of one of the standard kitchens were large enough to hold such items as 10000 pounds of beef and 6000 pounds of bread The kitchen facilities included a meat cutting room a tool room a scullery a garbage incinerator a great mess hall and finally the galleys each of which contained four large hotel ranges with worktables serving tables and all necessary cooking utensils Ten men did the cooking in each galley Each mess hall was 280 feet long End to end its metal topped tables measured 49525 feet in length Galleys storage rooms and mess halls had cement floors The whole plant was illuminated by electricity  Each mess hall at Brest was operated on the cafeteria plan Each was equipped to feed 20000 soldiers The men entered the hall marching in column of squads They passed through the galleys filling their kits with hot food then secured places at the tables ate and left the hall at the opposite end where there were refuse cans in which to scrape off their dishes and also tanks of boiling soapy water and hot rinsing water Here they cleaned their equipment The facilities were such that each kitchen could serve a brigade of troops entering the building at the ordinary marching pace Frequent inspections kept the food up to standard The camps at Brest also maintained night soup stands at which any soldier could get bread and hot soup between the hours of 830 pm and 230 am The force that operated the messing facilities at Brest numbered 1600 officers and men  At Bordeaux the troops temporarily occupying the embarkation camps cooked their own meals at the mess halls drawing their supplies from the camp organization At St Nazaire the messes were similar to those at Brest The old army transport McClellan which had crossed to France in the first American convoy in 1917 was stationed at St Nazaire where it served the subsistence organization as a floating refrigerator with capacity for 3000000 pounds of food The McClellan was too old to stand the buffeting of the North Atlantic and the Embarkation Service unwilling to risk bringing her home turned the ship over to the A E F After the expedition had returned to the United States the Government sold the McClellan to France  To the individual soldier quite the most important branch of the embarkation organization was that one which paid the money due him from the Government It paid him his money in francs either in the currency itself or by check and then saw to it that he exchanged his French money for its equivalent in American currency Both of these enterprises in financedisbursement and exchangewere in the hands of the A E F26 Quartermaster Corps The disbursement offered little difficulty although the monthly pay roll at Brest sometimes contained as many as 100000 names while those at St Nazaire and Bordeaux were proportionately large The question of foreign exchange presented more of a problem  Soon after the van of the A E F reached France the Treasury Department at Washington requested the War Department to pay all its troops on foreign soil in the money of the country in which they chanced to be stationed This meant that most of the men of the expedition received their pay in francs Before the armistice questions of currency exchange were of slight concern to the overseas soldier After the Government had deducted his allotment to his dependents his monthly premium payment for war risk insurance and his partial payment for any Liberty Bonds he might have purchased through the Army there was not much left for him anyhow When francs were cheaper he received more of them from the pay officer than he had expected but as long as he stayed in France and spent his money there the rate of exchange made little difference to him  French exchange continually strengthened during the sojourn of the expedition in Franceuntil after the armistice began The normal value of francs is 518 to the dollar In July 1917 the rate was 570 This rate gradually improved until at its strongest point it stood at 545 The few wounded men and casuals returning to the United States during this period were thus able to benefit financially by exchanging their French savings for American currency  After the armistice however and during the very time the expeditionary troops were returning to the United States in greatest numbers the exchange value of the franc slumped badly Shortly after November 11 1918 the rate was 580 to 1 It continued to fall steadily until in the autumn of 1919 it took 970 francs to purchase one dollar It follows that the provident soldier who had saved the francs paid to him on a basis of less than six to the dollar lost heavily when he was forced to convert his savings back into dollars again on a basis27 of nearly ten francs to the dollar The loss was particularly heavy upon officers who maintained drawing and savings accounts in French banks or who had not cashed their pay checks Sometimes too officers lost their checks Later they obtained duplicates which the declining exchange had made less valuable The War Department considered itself bound to protect soldiers from losses on this account Congress is now considering a war department bill which if enacted into law will provide for the reimbursement of losses incurred by soldiers because of variations in foreign exchange  It was good financial policy for the A E F to leave all its French currency behind as it embarked for the United States and to bring home only American money Yet it would have resulted in confusion in the A E F finances to have changed the pay system at the ports of embarkation Therefore the Quartermaster Corps did the next best thing it paid off the embarking troops in francs as usual and then immediately converted their francs into American currency Since both payment and exchange were at the same rate of exchange there was no loss to the troops in this transaction  In order to provide the American money for this exchange it was necessary for the Treasury to ship to France great quantities of currency It took the A E F some time to convince the Treasury Department of the necessity for such shipments The day after the armistice began the command of the A E F cabled to the Treasury requesting the immediate shipment of 500000 in currency an order afterwards increased to 2000000 This money did not actually reach the A E F until the last day of January 1919 By that date the expedition was beginning to embark rapidly There was not enough American currency in Europe to buy all the French money of the expeditionary troops and only by the most strenuous efforts could the Quartermaster Corps provide money for exchange until the first shipment of currency arrived from the United States Finance officers were stationed in Paris London and at the principal seaports with orders to buy all the American money they could secure By combing the banks and28 the countingrooms of brokers and by maintaining in Paris a fund from which shipments were rushed by motor convoys to the ports as these exhausted their supplies of currency the Corps managed to keep the exchange system running After the January shipment of 2000000 the Treasury Department arranged for an automatic supply of 10000000 every month  Meanwhile at the ports the Corps had built up the exchange plan Booths were set up on all docks and a force of disbursing quartermasters was organized to go on board all transports and exchange the money of soldiers who had failed to make the exchange on shore The A E F passed an order making it compulsory for all soldiers to exchange their cash before sailing Notices to this effect were posted conspicuously in all the embarkation camps In the larger units the officers attended to the matter collecting the French money from their men receiving American money for it from the exchange officers and then distributing the familiar currency among the troops Individuals and men traveling in small units attended to their own exchange The quartermasters at Brest distributed as much as 400000 in American currency in a single day Up to July 1 Brest had paid out 60000000 in American money to troops boarding ship there  By the late spring of 1919 most of the combat divisions except those on active duty with the Army of Occupation had crossed the ocean or had started for home By that time the facilities at the base ports had been developed to a capacity that enabled them to handle all further embarkations and the command of the expedition closed and abandoned the embarkation center at Le Mans All of the physical equipment there went to the French Government under the terms of the general sale consummated in August of that year On June 30 Bordeaux was closed as a port of embarkation It had embarked 258000 troops St Nazaire officially ceased to exist as a port of embarkation on July 26 although thereafter it embarked a few casuals Approximately 500000 American soldiers said farewell to France at St Nazaire  29  A million and a quarter American expeditionary soldiers departed from Brest for the United States Brest was the last of the ports to close The embarkation of the millionth American at Brest seemed almost as momentous as the arrival of the millionth American in France a year earlier In August General Pershing and the historic First Division sailed from Brest and the last of the combat troops had gone On October 1 American troops were stationed in France only at Brest and in Paris but Brest continued in operation as the port of embarkation until the last American had departed On October 1 there were a few thousand men still to sail but the A E F no longer existed in France Its headquarters had moved to Washington The great task was done  n the first day of the armistice before Washington knew its exact terms or could form an estimate of how great a force we should have to maintain in France pending the conclusion of permanent peace General Frank T Hines the Chief of the Embarkation Service which had administered the great work of transporting the 2000000 men of the A E F to France and had carried nearly half of them across the ocean in its own ships placed before the Secretary of War a plan for the return of the troops  It can be said that the outlook for the speedy repatriation of the overseas soldiers was not bright It had taken nearly seventeen months to transport the expedition to Europe and more than half of the men had crossed in the ships of other nations England had been the chief contributor of tonnage to our overseas movement prior to November 11 To build up on the western front the numerical superiority that was the chief factor in the victory the British Empire combed the seas for suitable passenger ships cut her own civilian requirements to the minimum and devoted to our transport service every ton of troopcarrying capacity she could procure France and Italy had each supplied a few vessels
